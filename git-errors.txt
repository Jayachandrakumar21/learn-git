hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

========================
The error message you're seeing:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to ...
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind...
means that someone else has pushed changes to the main branch on GitHub that you don't have in your local branch. Git is preventing you from overwriting those changes.

‚úÖ Solution: Pull the latest changes and then push
You have two main options:

üîÅ Option 1: Merge remote changes (safe & recommended)
This will pull remote changes and merge them into your local branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
Then push your changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them.

üîÑ Option 2: Rebase (clean history, but advanced)
If you want a cleaner history (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --rebase origin main
Then push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
‚ö†Ô∏è Option 3: Force Push (dangerous, only if you're sure)
This will overwrite the remote branch with your local version ‚Äî be careful as it will delete others‚Äô changes.

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main --force
Use this only if you‚Äôre certain your local version should override the remote version.

‚úÖ Best Practice:
Usually go with Option 1 (pull and merge) unless you know what you're doing.

Let me know if you want help resolving conflicts or understanding rebase!
